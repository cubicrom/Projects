# Conducting an A/A/B test and analyzing its results

**Research of a mobile application for the sale of food**

We work in a startup that sells food. We need to figure out how the users of our mobile application behave.

It is necessary to research the sales funnel. Find out how users reach the purchase. How many users reach the purchase, and how many are "stuck" on the previous steps and on which ones?

After that, we examine the results of the A/A/B experiment. Designers wanted to change fonts throughout the application, and managers were afraid that users would be unusual. We agreed to make a decision based on the results of the A/A/B test. Users were divided into 3 groups: 2 control ones with old fonts and one experimental one with new ones. It is necessary to find out which font is better.
