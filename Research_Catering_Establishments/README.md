# Market research of catering establishments

**Research of public catering establishments in Moscow for investors of the "Shut Up and Take My Money" fundÂ»**

Investors from the Shut Up and Take My Money fund decided to open a catering establishment in Moscow. Customers determine what kind of place it will be: a cafe, restaurant, pizzeria, pub or bar, and what the location, menu and prices will be.

Our task is to prepare a study of the Moscow market, find interesting features and present the results obtained, which in the future will help in choosing a suitable place for investors.

A dataset with Moscow catering establishments is available to us, compiled on the basis of data from Yandex Maps and Yandex Business services for the summer of 2022.
