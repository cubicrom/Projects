# Marketing Research for Procrastinate Pro+

Procrastinate Pro+ is an entertainment application. Despite huge investments in advertising, the company has been suffering losses for the past few months. Our task is to understand the reasons and help the company to become a plus.

There is data on users attracted from May 1 to October 27, 2019:

* server log with data about their visits;
* unloading their purchases for this period;
* advertising expenses.

We have to study:

1. where do users come from and what devices do they use;
2. how much does it cost to attract users from various advertising channels;
3. how much money does each client bring;
4. when the cost of attracting a client pays off;
5. what factors prevent attracting customers.
